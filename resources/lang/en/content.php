	'about_heading'	=> 'About Us',

<br/><br/>
All started when our Managing Director parked his car only for few hours, within an unauthorised area, on a Saturday night. On Sunday he found a parking ticket on his windscreen for the amount of £ 70 as well as marks at the left side of his car that were probably made by a sharp object. The funny thing about the story (if you can say it is funny) is that the parking choice in the unauthorized area was inevitable due to limited time. Time was previously spent as he drove his car to a nearby private car park and was told that the car park was full due to the high demand generated by a significant car rally event that was taking place on the next day.  
<br/><br/>
After this bad experience, it was understood that the parking space should have been reserved beforehand. In this way, the parking ticket, car damage, waste of time looking for a parking space and waste of money could have been avoided. Therefore, we decided to offer you the option to pre-book your parking space at secure car parks to avoid any bad experience and pre-book your parking space quickly, securely and receiving high quality of services at the lowest possible price.

	'terms_heading'	=> 'Terms and Conditions',
	'terms_content'	=>  '<strong style="text-align:center">The Company’s Liability</strong>
						<br/><br/>
						Parkinglegend.com acts as a booking agency only and therefore any liability and responsibility for all vehicles lie with the parking company, the hotel, the Meet and Greet service or any other transfer service (“Parking Provider”) reserved. The customer will be entering into an agreement with the company which provides the service ("Parking Provider") and will be subject to the service provider’s terms and conditions. 
						The terms and conditions will be available by the service provider ("Parking Provider"). Parkinglegend.com, as a booking agency for the Parking Provider, will be liable to the customer only in respect of losses arising directly from the negligence of the company while processing a parking reservation. 
						Any claim by the customer regarding the delivery of the parking service must be made against the Parking Provider and the service will be subject to its terms and conditions.
						<br/><br/>
						<strong style="text-align:center">Bookings</strong>
						<br/><br/>
						<ul>
							<li>
							A reservation made through parkinglegend.com will be considered as complete when a reservation number has been issued. A booking number is issued only when the customer has accepted all terms and conditions. 
							Even when the customer makes a reservation by phone, following the conversation with the company’s customer service consultant, all terms and conditions will be deemed to have been accepted by the customer.
							</li>
							<li>
							All services are subject to availability. The company reserves the right not to accept a reservation. A reservation is not a guaranteed parking space and the company may cancel a reservation if the Parking Provider advises that it is unable to accept it. 
							In these cases a full refund will be made, but the company will accept no liability for any consequential loss or losses arising.
							</li>
							<li>
							It is the responsibility of the customer to ensure that a valid e-mail address (so that all the information about the Parking Provider can be sent to the customer) and contact number (so that the Parking Provider or parkinglegend.com can contact the customer) have been provided. 
							Parkinglegend.com is not responsible for any costs or consequential loss or losses arising from the provision of invalid e-mail address or contact number(s). Moreover, it is the responsibility of the customer to read the booking confirmation along with all the information about the Parking Provider and to follow the appropriate procedure. 
							Parkinglegend.com is not responsible under any circumstances if the customer fails to follow the right procedure because of the fact that he/she did not read the booking confirmation. It is the responsibility of the customer to present the confirmation of the booking (booking voucher) at the car park staff as proof of the reservation placed on parkinglegend.com. 
							Parkinglegend.com will not be responsible and will not refund any money if the car park cancels or overcharges the customer due to the fact that the customer failed to display the booking confirmation (booking voucher).
							</li>
							<li>
							All the appropriate information about the car park (company name, company address, contact number, GPS coordinates) will be included within the booking confirmation (booking voucher), so that the customer can find the car park easily. It is the responsibility of the customer to have the booking voucher in his/her possession as well as valid directions before travelling. 
							Parkinglegend.com is not responsible for any loss or losses arising from the failure of the customer to bring along the booking voucher or failure of the customer to get valid directions.
							</li>
							<li>
							Each reservation is valid only for one entry/exit, unless otherwise agreed directly with the Parking Provider. 
							</li>
						</ul>
						<br/>
						<strong style="text-align:center">Payment</strong>
						<br/><br/>
						<ul>
							<li>
							Payment can be made by using one of the acceptable ways on parkinglegend.com. If a payment is not accepted by parkinglegend.com or the Parking Provider, they have the right not to complete the reservation.
							</li>
							<li>
							If a booking has been made with a card which has not been issued by a Greek financial institution, the card issuer may charge the customer for currency conversion. The exchange rate will be dependent on the date of processing the booking.
							</li>
							<li>
							All prices displayed on parkinglegend.com are in the local currency of the selected country and include VAT.
